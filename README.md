#### Introduction
This document is my marked down file for the GMIT module 'Programming for Data Analysis' Assignment. The project includes a review of numpy.random function included the Python library module NumPy. My review of the function is undertaken using a jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), which is included in this repository as 'numpy-random-review.ipynb'. This jupyter notebook uses the Python programming language (https://www.python.org/) to illustrate the numpy.random function.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed on the jupyter notebook viewer https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/markcot/ProgrammingFDA-Assignment/blob/master/numpy-random-review.ipynb?flush_cache=true.

The GitHub repository https://github.com/markcot/ProgrammingFDA-Assignment can be cloned to a local hard drive and run locally using jupyter notebook from the command line or terminal. When the notebook is first opened, the user should start by running all of code in the notebook. Select from the drop down option 'Restart & Run All' under the menu heading 'Kernel'.

#### Project Plan

- Review and describe random numbers
- Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
- Review and describe python numpy library
- Review and describe numpy.random package
- Explain use of "Simple random data" routines rand(), randn(), randint(), random(), choice() and bytes()
- Explain use of "Permutations" routines shuffle() and permutation()
- Explain use and purpose of "Distributions" routines beta(), binomial(), exponential(), logistic(), and poison()

#### Github Issues
Note that jupter notebook contains html text that may not appear correctly, when viewed directly on Github. The jupyter notebook should be viewed read only on the nbviewer so text is displayed correctly.
