#### Introduction
This document is my marked down file for the GMIT module 'Programming for Data Analysis' Assignment. The project includes a review of numpy.random package in Python. My review of the package is undertaken using a jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), which is included in this repository as 'numpy-random-review.ipynb'. This jupyter notebook uses the python programming language (https://www.python.org/) to illustrate the numpy.random package.

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a read only file on the GitHub repository page https://github.com/markcot/ProgrammingFDA-Assignment. This repository may be cloned to a local hard drive and run locally using jupyter notebook from the command line or terminal. When the notebook is first opened, the user should start by running all of code in the notebook. Select from the drop down option 'Restart & Run All' under the menu heading 'Kernel'.
